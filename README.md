This application refactors an existing E-Commerce application built on React's Context API into one leveraging Redux for global state management. Users are able to browse a limited collection of categorized demo products to construct their cart. Checkout is handled using the Stripe payment processing integration - operating in development mode. The application is deployed to Heroku and can be found here: [Redux Store](https://polar-sierra-41702.herokuapp.com/)
